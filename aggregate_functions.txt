An aggregate function computes a single result from multiple input rows. For example, there are aggregates to compute the count, sum, avg (average), max (maximum) and min (minimum) over a set of rows.

1) SELECT max(age) as max_age
	FROM public.students;

output:
max_age
21

2) SELECT min(age) as min_age
	FROM public.students;

output:
min_age
19

3)SELECT avg(age) as avg_age
	FROM public.students;

output:
avg_age
20.4000000000

4)SELECT sum(marks) as total_marks
	FROM public.students;

output:
total_marks
250

5)SELECT count(*) as total_rows
	FROM public.students;

output:
total_rows
5
